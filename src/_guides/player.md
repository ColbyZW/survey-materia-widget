Survey questions come in one of four types: multiple choice, check-all-that-apply, free response, and ranked choice.

- For **Multiple Choice** questions students are asked to select one out of a range of answer options.
- For **Check All That Apply** questions, students are asked to select one or more answer options.
- For **Free Response** questions, students can provide a phrase, sentence, or paragraph in response to the question prompt.
- For **Ranked Choice** or "sequence" questions, students are asked to rank a set of answer choices in preferential order.
